Couldn't Write test cases due to some time constraints.
However, this can be tested using frameworks like pytest or manually through postman by varying input fields and body for different test cases.


For deployment in production environment, I would prefer using docker to create a container image of this code, and then deploying it on cloud like AWS (amazon web services).
For serverless architecture like AWS Lambda, we may have to modify the code using APIs of AWS SDK.

Docker image can be created using the dockerfile which has all the relevant dependency and runtime information.
